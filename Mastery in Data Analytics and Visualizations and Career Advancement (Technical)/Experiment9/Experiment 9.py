# ================================================================
# STEP 14: EVALUATE DETECTION RESULTS
# ================================================================

# Correct Detection:
# An object is correctly detected when its class and location
# are identified correctly.

# False Detection:
# A false detection occurs when the model identifies an object
# incorrectly or detects an object where it does not exist.

# Missed Detection:
# A missed detection occurs when an object present in the image
# is not detected by the model.


# ================================================================
# STEP 15: ANALYZE MODEL PERFORMANCE
# ================================================================

# YOLO is a single-stage object detection model.
#
# It processes the image and predicts bounding boxes,
# class labels and confidence scores.
#
# YOLO provides fast inference and can be used for
# applications requiring quick object detection.
#
# Detection performance can be affected by:
# - Lighting conditions
# - Object size
# - Occlusion
# - Complex backgrounds
# - Image quality
# - Overlapping objects


# ================================================================
# STEP 16: REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS
# ================================================================

# Object detection can be used in:
#
# 1. Autonomous vehicles
# 2. Surveillance systems
# 3. Healthcare
# 4. Retail analytics
# 5. Industrial inspection
#
# These applications are listed in the experiment description.

# ================================================================
# STEP 17: OBSERVATIONS
# ================================================================

# Observation 1:
# The pre-trained YOLO model successfully detects objects
# present in the uploaded image.
#
# Observation 2:
# Bounding boxes identify the location of detected objects.
#
# Observation 3:
# Class labels identify the category of each detected object.
#
# Observation 4:
# Confidence scores indicate the model's confidence
# for each detection.
#
# Observation 5:
# Multiple objects can be detected from a single image.
#
# Observation 6:
# Detection performance can be affected by lighting,
# object size, occlusion and complex backgrounds.
#
# Observation 7:
# Pre-trained deep learning models can detect complex
# visual patterns without manually designing image features.
#
# Observation 8:
# Object detection combines object localization and
# object classification.


# ================================================================
# QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
# ================================================================

# Q1. Differentiate between image classification,
#     object detection and image segmentation.
#
# Answer:
# Image classification assigns a class label to the complete image.
#
# Object detection identifies objects and provides their
# class labels and bounding boxes.
#
# Image segmentation assigns labels to individual pixels
# or regions of an image.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Q2. Explain the working principle of YOLO.
#
# Answer:
# YOLO stands for You Only Look Once.
#
# It processes the complete image using a deep learning
# neural network and predicts bounding boxes, class labels
# and confidence scores.
#
# YOLO performs detection in a single main detection process,
# which makes it suitable for fast object detection.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Q3. Compare YOLO, SSD and Faster R-CNN based on speed,
#     accuracy and practical applications.
#
# Answer:
# YOLO and SSD are single-stage object detection methods
# designed for fast detection.
#
# Faster R-CNN is a two-stage object detection method that
# first generates region proposals and then performs
# classification and localization.
#
# YOLO and SSD are commonly suitable for applications where
# fast inference is important, while Faster R-CNN uses a
# more computationally intensive two-stage approach.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Q4. What is a bounding box? Why is it important?
#
# Answer:
# A bounding box is a rectangular box surrounding a detected
# object in an image.
#
# It is important because it provides the location and
# approximate size of the detected object.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Q5. Explain the significance of confidence score and IoU.
#
# Answer:
# A confidence score represents the model's confidence
# in a particular object detection.
#
# IoU stands for Intersection over Union.
#
# It measures the overlap between the predicted bounding
# box and the ground-truth bounding box.
#
# A higher IoU indicates greater overlap between the
# predicted and actual bounding boxes.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Q6. What are the advantages of using pre-trained deep
#     learning models over traditional image processing?
#
# Answer:
# Pre-trained deep learning models have already learned
# useful visual features from large datasets.
#
# They reduce the need to train a complete model from
# the beginning and can identify complex patterns.
#
# Traditional image processing generally depends more
# on manually designed features and rules.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Q7. Why are datasets such as MS COCO and Pascal VOC
#     widely used?
#
# Answer:
# MS COCO and Pascal VOC contain labeled images with
# different object categories and localization information.
#
# They are widely used for training, testing and
# evaluating object detection algorithms.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Q8. Mention five real-world applications of object detection.
#
# Answer:
#
# 1. Autonomous vehicles
# 2. Surveillance systems
# 3. Healthcare
# 4. Retail analytics
# 5. Industrial inspection


# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Q9. What challenges are commonly encountered while
#     detecting objects in complex real-world environments?
#
# Answer:
#
# Common challenges include:
#
# 1. Poor lighting
# 2. Object occlusion
# 3. Overlapping objects
# 4. Small objects
# 5. Complex backgrounds
# 6. Different object sizes
# 7. Camera movement
# 8. Low-quality images


# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Q10. How can object detection systems be further improved?
#
# Answer:
#
# Object detection systems can be improved using:
#
# 1. Larger and more diverse datasets
# 2. Data augmentation
# 3. Improved deep learning architectures
# 4. Better feature extraction
# 5. Improved training techniques
# 6. Model optimization
# 7. Better hardware
# 8. Recent computer vision techniques
